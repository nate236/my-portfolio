# React Portfolio

## Description

As I apply for jobs or freelance, my portfolio becomes more than just a collection of projectsâ€”it serves as a dynamic space to showcase my skills and connect with other developers. By building my portfolio using the latest React technologies, I will not only highlight your expertise but also stand out in a competitive field where many portfolios still lag behind current trends. Finally, deploying my application to Netlify, as outlined in the Git Guide or Netlify's Docs, ensures that my work is accessible and professionally presented to the world.
