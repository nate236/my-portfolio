        {/* Replace this placeholder text with your own paragraph */}
        Welcome to my portfolio! I am a dedicated and enthusiastic professional with a diverse educational background that uniquely blends technical proficiency with strategic management. I graduated from Ohio University, where I pursued a degree in Engineering Technology and Management. This rigorous program provided me with a solid foundation in both the technical aspects of engineering and the strategic principles required to lead projects and teams effectively. It was here that I developed a keen interest in how technology and management intersect to drive innovation and efficiency across various industries.

Determined to further enhance my skill set, I embarked on an immersive software development journey through Ohio State's Bootcamp. This experience has allowed me to dive deep into modern programming languages, state-of-the-art frameworks, and agile methodologies that are shaping the future of technology. Working on collaborative projects and tackling real-world challenges has not only sharpened my technical abilities but also honed my problem-solving skills and adaptability. I am continuously inspired by the endless possibilities that technology offers and am eager to leverage these new skills to create impactful solutions.

Beyond academics and bootcamp training, I have a passion for lifelong learning and a commitment to excellence. I thrive in environments that encourage creativity, innovation, and teamwork, and I am constantly seeking opportunities to push the boundaries of what’s possible. Whether it’s developing cutting-edge applications or strategizing solutions to complex problems, I believe in the power of technology to drive meaningful change. As I transition into my professional career, I look forward to combining my technical expertise and management insights to contribute to projects that deliver real value and foster growth in the tech industry.
